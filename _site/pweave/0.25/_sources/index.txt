Pweave - Scientific Reports Using Python
========================================

Pweave is a scientific report generator and a literate programming
tool for Python. Pweave can capture the results and plots from data
analysis and works well with NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib. It is able to run
python code from source document and include the results and capture
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ plots in the output.

It can produce reST, Sphinx, Latex, HTML and markdown (pandoc and leanpub)
output from several input formats.

- Noweb  uses `noweb <http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/>`_ syntax for separating code from documentation.
- Markdown. Run code from markdown code blocks.
- Script. Python script with special markup in comments. See: :ref:`publishing scripts <publish>`.

Pweave is good for creating reports, tutorials, presentations etc. with embedded python
code It can also be used to make websites together with e.g. Sphinx or rest2web.

There is now also Pweave syntax highlighting for Atom editor using
`language-weave <https://atom.io/packages/language-weave>`_ .

.. warning:: **Note: pip install of Pweave fails in Python 3**. This is due to a bug in pip. Youâ€™ll
   need to use "conda", "easy install" or download the source and run ``python setup.py install``.

.. note::

Features:
---------

* Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 compatibility
* **Execute python code** in the chunks and **capture** input and output to a report.
* **Use hidden code chunks,** i.e. code is executed, but not printed in the output file.
* Capture matplotlib graphics.
* Evaluate inline code in documentation chunks marked using ``<% %>`` and ``<%= %>``.
* Cache all code and results from previous runs for fast report
  generation when you are only working with documentation. Inline code
  will be hidden in documentation mode.
* Supports reST, LaTeX, HTML or markdown for document chunks
* Publish reports from Python scipts. Similar to R markdown.
* Run from command line or interpreter.
* Support also for Octave and Matlab code.

Pweave was originally inspired by `Sweave <http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/>`_, an excellent tool
for R programmers. The current version has also been influenced by ideas from `knitr <http://yihui.name/knitr/>`_
and `R markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>`_.
