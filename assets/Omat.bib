  abstract = {Foals’ locomotory and lying down behavior can be an indicator of their health and development. However, measurement tools have not been well described with previously reported attachment sites used on limbs of adult horses unsafe for longer-term data collection in foals. In this study a tail-mounted three-dimensional accelerometer was validated for monitoring foals lying, standing and walking behavior. Eleven foals were recruited; four hospitalized and seven at private breeding stables. Accelerometers were attached to the dorsal aspect of the base of each foal’s tail and their behavior was video recorded. Hospitalized foals had continuous video monitoring inside their stalls, and the breeding stable’s foals were monitored outside at pasture for 1-5 time periods (mean 42 minutes per period), depending how long they were at the facility. Acceleration was measured using 100Hz frequency and mean, maximum, and minimum acceleration were recorded in 5 second epochs for x-, y- and z-axes. Lying, standing and walking behavior was monitored from videos of all foals, and the start and end time of each behavior was compared with the corresponding data from the accelerometer. Naive Bayes classifier was developed by using dynamic body acceleration and cranio-caudal movement of the tail (tilt along z-axis), to predict foal´s lying behavior. The model was validated; the classifier achieved high accuracy in precision and in classifying foals lying behavior (specificity 0.92, sensitivity 0.89, precision 0.98, accuracy 0.92). The overall accuracy for classifying walking and standing was also good, but the precision was poor (0.46 and 0.24, respectively). When standing and walking behavior was combined to a single “standing or walking” class, the precision improved (specificity 0.62, sensitivity 0.92, precision 0.89, accuracy 0.92). In conclusion, tail-mounted three-dimensional accelerometer can be used for monitoring foals lying behavior. In addition, information regarding standing and walking can be gained with this method.},

	abstract = {Heat stress is one of the most critical issues jeopardising animal welfare and productivity during the warm season in dairy cattle farms. The global trend of increase in average and peak temperatures is making the problem more and more serious. Many devices have been introduced in livestock farms to monitor and control temperature-humidity index, as well as animal behaviour and production parameters. The consequent availability of collected databases has increasingly enhanced the research aimed to understand the consequences of heat stress in cattle, in relation to genetic, reproductive, productive and behavioural features. Moreover, these investigations laid the foundations for the development, calibration, validation and test of numerical models quantifying the individual responses to heat stress conditions. In this work, a generalised additive model with mixed effects has been developed to analyse the relationship between milk production, animal behaviour and environmental parameters based on data surveyed in 2016 in an Italian dairy farm. Each cow has been characterised in terms of her response to heat conditions, and the results led to define three classes of susceptibility to heat stress within the herd. These attributes have then been related to the various phenotypic parameters collected by the precision livestock farming devices used in the farm. The study provides a model to understand the effects of heat stress conditions on individual animals in relation to the main parameters describing their rearing conditions; moreover, the results contribute to improve the herd management by lending indications to define targeted treatments according to the cow’s characteristics.},

    abstract = { Consumption of animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs in first-world countries has leveled off, but it is rising precipitously in developing countries. Agriculture will have to increase its output to meet demand, opening the door to increased automation and technological innovation; intensified, sustainable farming; and precision livestock farming (PLF) applications. Early indicators of medical problems, which use sensors to alert cattle farmers early concerning individual animals that need special care, are proliferating. Wearable technologies dominate the market. In less-value-per-animal systems like sheep, goat, pig, poultry, and fish, one sensor, like a camera or robot per herd/flock/school, rather than one sensor per animal, will become common. PLF sensors generate huge amounts of data, and many actors benefit from PLF data. No standards currently exist for sharing sensor-generated data, limiting the use of commercial sensors. Technologies providing accurate data can enhance a well-managed farm. Development of methods to turn the data into actionable solutions is critical.

Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1?3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day. The awake bouts also showed an interaction effect with longer bouts at daytime during day 1 compared to daytime on day 3. Data on sleep and awake states recorded in adult dairy cows during three consecutive 24-h periods showed great variation in sleep time between cows, but total time for each state was not significantly affected by recording day. Further and more detailed studies of how sleep architecture is affected by recording day is necessary to fully comprehend the first-night effect in dairy cows.},

Daily lying time decreased steeply during early lactation to a minimum around four weeks after calving, followed by a steady increase towards the end of lactation. Motion index and step frequency during walking exhibited a similar pattern. An adapted version of Wilmink's function for lactation curves was used to model these behaviours in relation to days in milk.

	abstract = {Piglet mortality is a continuing problem in modern pig production. It is high especially during the first few days after birth and can be reduced by supervision of farrowing. There is currently a trend to move towards housing without crates due to animal welfare concerns. Thus, automatic systems that can predict farrowing equally well in different housing systems would have wider applicability than ones developed for crated systems only. A method that works with same parameters in different housing systems would be easier to maintain and reuse in different conditions. The aim of this study was to develop a new accelerometer based system to measure sow activity before farrowing. This data was then used to build a model to predict the approach of farrowing, based on increased activity, within 24h before the start of farrowing. We used a wireless 3D accelerometer to measure the activity of sows in order to detect farrowing. The accelerometer collars were attached to neck collars of 29 sows farrowing in crates and 33 sows farrowing in pens. We expected sows in pens to show higher activity, but a similar rise in the level. We used a single model to detect farrowing in both crates and pens. A dynamic linear model was used to model the activity of the sows before farrowing and to extract trend component from seasonal components and a CUSUM chart was used to detect activity increase. The model detected a rise in activity on average 13±4.8h (mean±standard deviation) before farrowing in sows housed in crates and pens with sensitivity of 96.7\% and specificity of 100\%. The fact that we were able to use a single model with a constant set of parameters gives indication that the method has potential to become a robust indicator of farrowing in different housing systems, even though pre-farrowing activity was higher in sows housed in pens than in crates.},

	abstract = {In the year 2006 about 4000 farms worldwide used over 6000 milking robots. With increased automation the time that the cattle keeper uses for monitoring animals has decreased. This has created a need for automatic health monitoring systems. Lameness is a crucial welfare and economic issue in modern dairy husbandry. It causes problems especially in loose housing of cattle. This could be greatly reduced by early identification and treatment. A four-balance system for automatically measuring the load on each leg of a cow during milking in a milking robot has been developed. It has been previously shown that the weight distribution between limbs changes when cow get lame. In this paper we suggest CUSUM charts to automatically detect lameness based on the measurements. CUSUM charts are statistical based control charts and are well suited for checking a measuring system in operation for any departure from some target or specified values. The target values for detecting lameness were calculated from the cow’s own historical data so that each animal had an individual chart. The method enables objective monitoring of the changes in leg health, which is valuable information in veterinary research because it provides means for assessing the severity and impact of different causes of lameness and also evaluating the effect of treatment and medication. So far no objective method for calculating these measures has been available and the methodology presented in this paper seems very promising for the task.},

Leg weights of 73 cows were successfully recorded during almost 10,000 robotic milkings over a period of 5 mo. Cows were scored weekly for locomotion, and lame cows were inspected clinically for hoof lesions. Unsuccessful measurements, caused by cows standing outside the balances, were removed from the data with a special algorithm, and the mean leg loads and number of kicks during milking were calculated. To develop an expert system to automatically detect lameness cases, a model was needed, and a classifying probabilistic neural network model was chosen for the task. The data were divided into 2 parts and 5,074 measurements from 37 cows were used to train a classifying probabilistic neural network model. The operation of the model was evaluated for its ability to detect lameness in the validating data set, which had 4,868 measurements from 36 cows. The model was able to classify 96.2\% of the measurements correctly as sound or lame cows, and 100\% of the lameness cases in the validation data were identified. The number of measurements (equal to the number of milkings) causing false alarms was 1.1\%. The model developed has the potential to be used as an on-farm decision aid and can be used in a real-time lameness monitoring system.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a supervised classification approach for the real-time pattern recognition of sows in an animal supervision system (asup). Our approach offers the possibility of the foreground subtraction in an asup’s image processing module where there is lack of statistical information regarding the background. A set of 7 farrowing sessions of sows, during day and night, have been captured (approximately 7days/sow), which is used for this study. The frames of these recordings have been grabbed with a time shift of 20s. A collection of 215 frames of 7 different sows with the same lighting condition have been marked and used as the training set. Based on small neighborhoods around a point, a number of image local features are defined, and their separability and performance metrics are compared. For the classification task, a feed-forward neural network (NN) is studied and a realistic configuration in terms of an acceptable level of accuracy and computation time is chosen. The results show that the dense neighborhood feature (d.3×3) is the smallest local set of features with an acceptable level of separability, while it has no negative effect on the complexity of NN. The results also confirm that a significant amount of the desired pattern is accurately detected, even in situations where a portion of the body of a sow is covered by the crate’s elements. The performance of the proposed feature set coupled with our chosen configuration reached the rate of 8.5fps. The true positive rate (TPR) of the classifier is 84.6\%, while the false negative rate (FNR) is only about 3\%. A comparison between linear logistic regression and NN shows the highly non-linear nature of our proposed set of features.},

Correspondingly, the model distinguished 66±8\% and 70±6\% of the total time for NREM and REM sleep. 70±6\% of the NREM sleep bout lengths and 80±5\% of the REM sleep bouts were predicted. The numbers for NREM and REM bouts were 77±5\% and 79±4\%, respectively. The model correctly predicted 96±1\% of total lying time, 79±6\% of lying bout durations, and 77±7\% of the occurrence of lying bouts.

Thus, we conducted this study to characterize perceptions and practices of dairy producers on disbudding and disbudding-related pain management. A questionnaire was sent to 1,000 randomly selected Finnish dairy producers (response rate: 45\%). Our aim was to investigate producer perceptions about disbudding-related pain, the perceived need for pain alleviation before disbudding, and how these perceptions affect the valuing and use of pain alleviation before disbudding. More than 70\% of Finnish dairy farms disbud their calves. Producers who ranked disbudding-related pain and need for pain alleviation higher called a veterinarian to medicate calves before disbudding more often than producers who ranked disbudding pain and need for pain alleviation lower. Among respondents who disbudded calves on their farms, 69\% stated that disbudding caused severe pain, 63\% stated that pain alleviation during disbudding is important, and 45\% always had a veterinarian medicate their calves before disbudding. Producers with a herd healthcare agreement with their veterinarian estimated disbudding-related pain to be higher and had a veterinarian medicate calves more often than producers without such an agreement. Producers with tiestall systems and producers who did not use disbudding valued pain alleviation prior to disbudding higher than producers with freestalls and producers who used disbudding.},

Lame cows were identified with different numerical rating scores (NRS) used as thresholds (NRS {\textgreater}3 and NRS ≥3.5) for lameness. The ratio of weight applied to a pair of legs (LWR) when the cow was standing was calculated using a special weigh scale, and the cows were gait scored using a 1 to 5 NRS. Hoof lesions were scored and the cows placed into 1 of 4 mutually exclusive categories of hoof lesion: a) no lesions, b) moderate or severe hemorrhages, c) digital dermatitis, and d) sole ulcers. Regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the relation between hoof lesions and LWR. A clear relationship was found between NRS and LWR for the cows with sole ulcers (R2=0.79). The LWR could differentiate cows with sole ulcers from sound cows with no hoof lesions [area under the curve (AUC)=0.87] and lame cows from nonlame cows with lameness thresholds NRS {\textgreater}3 (AUC=0.71) and NRS ≥3.5 (AUC=0.88). There was no relationship between LWR and NRS for cows with digital dermatitis.

The accelerometers used a wireless 869MHz radio channel for transmitting the acceleration data, measured at 25Hz with a sensitivity of 6g. The data were logged to a computer in real time via a receiver. The variance and wavelet variance for each axis and the total acceleration for each leg were calculated, and differences in the symmetry of variance of the hind legs of forward acceleration during the gait of lame and sound cows were determined from the accelerometer data. In addition, the wavelet variance of the lame cows showed differences on level 1 wavelet detail, associated with changes over a 40ms time scale (i.e. mainly the stage when the leg hits the ground).},

The method utilises only arithmetic operations and is adaptive to individual ECG curves and electrode installation effects. The method tracks the average heights of the sample points preceding and following the S-wave peak. Comparing these heights to the long-time average values provides an estimate of the offset of the peak sample from the actual peak moment. On average, the prediction of spline interpolation on the original 512 Hz turning point is 0.043 ms more accurate than our geometrical algorithm. Both methods result in less than a 0.7 ms difference from the original data. However, the proposed method is significantly more computationally efficient than cubic spline interpolation.},

	abstract = {The automated, reliable, and early detection of lameness is an important aim for the future development of modern dairy operations. One promising indicator of lameness is a change in the feeding behavior of a cow. In this study, the associations between feeding behavior and lameness were evaluated. A herd of 50 cows was investigated during the winter season in a freestall barn. Feeding behavior, feed intake, milk yield, and body weight were monitored using electronic feeding troughs and an automated milking system. Gait scoring every second week was used as a measure of lameness. To analyze the effect of lameness on feeding behavior and milk yield, linear mixed models were used. Cows with more severe lameness spent less time feeding per day (104±4, 101±4, and 91±4min/d for lameness scores 2, 3, and 4, respectively). An interaction between parity and lameness score was detected, with severely lame primiparous cows spending the least time feeding. Severely lame cows fed faster; however, their body weights were lower than for less-lame cows. Increase in lactation stage was associated with longer daily feeding time, longer duration of feeding bouts, and lower feeding rate. Worsening of gait was associated with lower silage intake and less time spent feeding even before severe lameness was scored. The results indicate that lameness is associated with changes in feeding behavior and that such changes could be considered in the future development of remote monitoring systems. It should also be noted that impaired feeding behavior along with lameness can put the welfare of especially early lactating primiparous cows at risk.},

	abstract = {Conclusive data regarding behavioural indicators of different sleep states in adult dairy cows are lacking, i.e. agreement between behavioural indicators of sleep and corresponding electrophysiological measures. Behavioural estimates for quantifying total sleep time in calves have been developed, so this study examined whether these behavioural estimates also apply for adult cows. Behaviour observations and electrophysiological readings were recorded for a total of 13 cows during one recording session per cow lasting on average 4h 22min. Recording started when the cow was fully awake and finished when at least one probable sleep bout had been recorded. The behavioural estimates used in the study were: ‘lying with head lifted and still’ for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, ‘lying with head resting’ for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and ‘lying with head lifted and moving’ for awakeness. As statistical measures of agreement between behavioural estimates and electrophysiological status (both recorded at 30s intervals), Cohen's kappa as well as sensitivity and specificity measures were calculated. Additionally, misclassifications were evaluated to better understand agreement between the behaviour and electrophysiological sleep classification. Since interval length might have affected the agreement, the output data were also aggregated into 60, 90 and 120s intervals and analysed using Wilcoxon sign-rank test to determine the most appropriate interval length. It was found that the behavioural estimates for assessing total sleep time in calves could not be applied to adult cows as they markedly overestimated NREM and REM sleep time. Behavioural estimates for NREM and REM sleep time were on average 124±17 and 14±4min per cow, respectively, while the electrophysiological estimate for NREM and REM was on average 20±5 and 10±3min per cow, respectively. Using the behavioural estimate ‘lying with head resting’, REM sleep could be identified with moderate precision, but this indicator alone likely underestimates total duration of REM sleep. Behavioural estimates for NREM sleep showed high sensitivity (81\%) but low specificity (6\%) while the behavioural estimates for REM sleep showed high sensitivity (70\%) and moderate specificity (41\%). For both categories, both sensitivity and specificity increased with increasing measurement interval length. Drowsing as identified from electrophysiological data was present mainly when the cows were lying with head lifted and still, whereas awakeness was present when the cows were lying with head lifted and moving.},

	abstract = {Pain is an important indicator of poor welfare of livestock. Despite this, pain has largely gone unrecognized in farm animals due to attitudes of producers and veterinarians, although they play a key role in monitoring and managing the perception of animal pain. Producer attitudes toward animal welfare influence livestock management and production. The aim was to quantify dairy producer attitudes to the painfulness of various cattle diseases and disbudding, a painful routine procedure performed on farm to ensure safer handling of cattle. A questionnaire on disbudding-related opinions and practices was sent to 1,000 Finnish dairy producers (response rate: 45\%). Attitudes toward disbudding were gauged using a 5-point Likert scale and attitudes to cattle pain scored on an 11-point numerical rating scale. Principal components analysis was used to assess the loadings, which were further tested for differences between producer gender and housing systems with Mann-Whitney U-tests, and between herd milk yield, herd size, and age and work experience of producers with a Kruskal-Wallis test. Four main factors were identified: factor I (“taking disbudding pain seriously”), factor II (“sensitivity to pain caused by cattle diseases”), factor III (“ready to medicate calves myself”), and factor IV (“pro horns”). Female producers took disbudding pain more seriously, were more sensitive to pain caused to cattle by diseases, and were more ready to medicate disbudded calves than male producers. Producers with tie-stalls favored horns over producers with freestalls. Male producers with tie-stalls were sensitive to cattle pain and preferred horns over male producers with freestalls. Female producers with freestalls were more ready to medicate calves, but did not prefer horns more than female producers with tie-stalls. Taking disbudding seriously correlated with sensitivity to pain caused by cattle diseases. Producers with low-milk-yielding herds were less willing to medicate calves and more willing to keep cattle with horns than producers with higher-yielding herds. Older producers were more sensitive to cattle pain than middle-aged and younger producers. No effect was established for taking disbudding pain seriously: the pro-horn factor was associated with work experience, age, and herd size. Women rated pain higher and were more positive toward pain medication for animals than men. Maintaining horns are more important for producers with tie-stalls than for those with freestalls.},

Sleep in animals is often estimated by behavioural observations, or recorded on restrained animals with invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques, which might affect sleep patterns. Earlier studies on sleep in cows showed that they sleep about 4h per day and drowse almost twice the time. The aim of this study was to record and differentiate between vigilance states in dairy cows using a non-invasive EEG method. Brain activity (electroencephalography, EEG), eye movements (electrooculography, EOG) and muscle activity (electromyography, EMG) were recorded for 6h per animal using surface-attached electrodes to measure different vigilance states. Behaviour registrations from direct observations were combined with the EEG data in order to confirm the identification of different vigilance states from the EEG, EOG and EMG recordings. 8 dry dairy cows, lactation number 1–8 and age 3–11 years, of the Swedish Red breed from the research herd at Kungsängen Research Centre, Uppsala, Sweden, were used in the study. The EEG recordings showed that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep displayed low frequency waves, sometimes with slow wave activity. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and alert wakefulness shared similar features of desynchronised waves with varying frequency and could be differentiated by reduced neck muscle activity during REM sleep. The main conclusion from this study is that it is possible to distinguish different vigilance states in dairy cows using surface-attached EEG electrodes.},

	abstract = {Acute mastitis is one of the most common diseases of high-producing dairy cows. However, there is still lack of knowledge on which precise behaviours change first at the beginning of acute mastitis, and whether behavioural changes might serve as a tool for early detection of clinical mastitis. In addition, mastitis can cause motivational conflict in the behavioural priorities of a cow, and thus blur the classical patterns of sickness behaviour: cows’ increased lying behaviour which may be uncomfortable or painful due to the sore udder. To study this, we monitored the behaviour of six cows after induction of acute endotoxin mastitis. Cows served as their own controls. Their behaviour was filmed from 1 day before the induction (control day) to 24h after the induction (induction day). To follow-up on the inflammation, milk samples were taken and the cows’ health status was checked at regular intervals. Mean daily durations were determined for all behaviours, except stepping and body care, for which mean daily frequencies were counted. For standing and lying behaviours, also mean bout durations were analyzed. To examine the effects of time since the induction of mastitis, data were accordingly divided in 2-h periods. We analyzed the effect of induction on overall behaviour and behavioural rhythms with linear mixed models, taking repeated observations into account. Overall cows spent less time lying on the induction day than on the day before, and less on the side of the inflamed udder quarter. Cows also spent longer time overall for eating silage during the induction day, and they also stepped more than during the previous day. Cows spent less time lying and ruminated and drank less when the udder was severely swollen and when they had high fever. We concluded that unlike in typical sickness behaviour, cows did not increase their time spent lying, but instead stood more, and avoided lying on the side of the inflamed udder quarter. We suggest that pain experienced in the udder overrides the motivational the state of the cows’ sickness behaviour. In the future, novel mastitis detection tools should therefore be able automatically detect and combine changes on both physiological parameters (i.e. fever) and complete behavioural patterns consisting of resting, standing and eating behaviours.},

	abstract = {The aims were to determine whether measures of acceleration of the legs and back of dairy cows while they walk could help detect changes in gait or locomotion associated with lameness and differences in the walking surface. In 2 experiments, 12 or 24 multiparous dairy cows were fitted with five 3-dimensional accelerometers, 1 attached to each leg and 1 to the back, and acceleration data were collected while cows walked in a straight line on concrete (experiment 1) or on both concrete and rubber (experiment 2). Cows were video-recorded while walking to assess overall gait, asymmetry of the steps, and walking speed. In experiment 1, cows were selected to maximize the range of gait scores, whereas no clinically lame cows were enrolled in experiment 2. For each accelerometer location, overall acceleration was calculated as the magnitude of the 3-dimensional acceleration vector and the variance of overall acceleration, as well as the asymmetry of variance of acceleration within the front and rear pair of legs. In experiment 1, the asymmetry of variance of acceleration in the front and rear legs was positively correlated with overall gait and the visually assessed asymmetry of the steps (r ≥0.6). Walking speed was negatively correlated with the asymmetry of variance of the rear legs (r=−0.8) and positively correlated with the acceleration and the variance of acceleration of each leg and back (r ≥0.7). In experiment 2, cows had lower gait scores [2.3 vs. 2.6; standard error of the difference (SED)=0.1, measured on a 5-point scale] and lower scores for asymmetry of the steps (18.0 vs. 23.1; SED=2.2, measured on a continuous 100-unit scale) when they walked on rubber compared with concrete, and their walking speed increased (1.28 vs. 1.22m/s; SED=0.02). The acceleration of the front (1.67 vs. 1.72g; SED=0.02) and rear (1.62 vs. 1.67g; SED=0.02) legs and the variance of acceleration of the rear legs (0.88 vs. 0.94g; SED=0.03) were lower when cows walked on rubber compared with concrete. Despite the improvements in gait score that occurred when cows walked on rubber, the asymmetry of variance of acceleration of the front leg was higher (15.2 vs. 10.4\%; SED=2.0). The difference in walking speed between concrete and rubber correlated with the difference in the mean acceleration and the difference in the variance of acceleration of the legs and back (r ≥0.6). Three-dimensional accelerometers seem to be a promising tool for lameness detection on farm and to study walking surfaces, especially when attached to a leg.},

	abstract = {During transport from the farm to the slaughter house birds are often confined in crates with limited space. In this study we investigated how the confinement of male turkeys in crates of 40, 55 or 90cm height for 6h, affected the turkeys welfare. We used both behavioural observations and physiological measures and the study was carried out under experimental conditions. Thirty-six turkeys were placed singly in stationary crates for 6h and during this time their behaviour was observed. The confinement for each bird was carried out twice on two separate occasions with around 1 week between confinements. The mean (±SE) weight of the birds in the first confinement period was 15.9±0.2kg and on the second occasion 17.3±0.2kg. Blood-samples were taken after the behaviour observations were finished and analyses of activities of creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and lactate were carried out. The heterophil:lymphocyte ratio (H:L) was also determined. The behaviour observations revealed that birds in the 40cm crates did not perform any standing (standing with straight legs), whereas birds in 55 and 90cm crates spent 35.4±4.3 and 42.2±5.8\% of the time, respectively, in this position. Conversely, birds in the 40cm crates spent significantly more time in a low standing position (standing with the legs bent) than birds in the 55 and 90cm crates. More stepping, turning and preening was performed in the 55 and 90cm compared to the 40cm crates, whereas more rising attempts were made in the 40cm crates. Crate height had no effect on the activity of ASAT or CK activity or H:L ratio. There was a significant effect of crate height on the lactate with birds in the 55cm crates having significantly lower lactate concentrations than birds in 40cm crates, but there was no significant difference in lactate concentration between 55 and 90cm or between the 40 and 90cm crates. This may indicate that there was a difference between treatments on the anaerobic activity, although the effect of sampling procedure cannot be completely excluded. Thus the degree of confinement in the crates had little influence on the physiological measures taken, although there was a large effect on the birds’ behaviour. The 40cm crates decreased the birds possibility to move and change their positions, whereas the 55cm crates allowed the birds to stand up and move around almost as much as if kept in free height, even if they were not able to stretch their necks while standing.},

In this study, a thermal camera was tested for its capacity to detect clinical mastitis. Mastitis was experimentally induced in 6 cows with 10μg of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The LPS was infused into the left forequarter of each cow, and the right forequarters served as controls. Clinical examination for systemic and local signs and sampling for indicators of inflammation in milk were carried out before morning and evening milking throughout the 5-d experimental period and more frequently on the challenge day. Thermal images of experimental and control quarters were taken at each sampling time from lateral and medial angles. The first signs of clinical mastitis were noted in all cows 2h postchallenge and included changes in general appearance of the cows and local clinical signs in the affected udder quarter. Rectal temperature, milk somatic cell count, and electrical conductivity were increased 4h postchallenge and milk N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activity 8h postchallenge. The thermal camera was successful in detecting the 1 to 1.5°C temperature change on udder skin associated with clinical mastitis in all cows because temperature of the udder skin of the experimental and control quarters increased in line with the rectal temperature. Yet, local signs on the udder were seen before the rise in udder skin and body temperature. The udder represents a sensitive site for detection of any febrile disease using a noninvasive method. A thermal camera mounted in a milking or feeding parlor could detect temperature changes associated with clinical mastitis or other diseases in a dairy herd.},

	abstract = {Farrowing is an important economic phase in pig production. In modern pig herds the lack of surveillance at farrowing is a current animal health and welfare problem. One of the clearest signals of impending farrowing is the sow's increased activity caused by nest-building behaviour. Six farrowing crates were equipped with a system to monitor sow activity. Each crate was equipped with a photocell (E3F2, Omron Europe, The Netherlands) placed at a height of 0.6m. In three crates, a thin-film ferroelectret force sensor (L-series, Emfit Ltd., Finland) was also installed under the sows. The force sensor measured the overall movement of the sows and the photocells were used to detect whether they were lying down or standing up. The mean time sows spent standing was significantly higher in the 24-h interval prior to farrowing than in all the other 24-h intervals monitored (p{\textless}0.05). The force sensor recorded a significantly higher number of peaks in the 24-h interval prior to farrowing than in all the other 24-h intervals monitored (p{\textless}0.05). Thus, our results indicate that these sensors can serve to measure sow activity with impending parturition and both sensors can provide similar information.},

Ghrelin has been identified in the gastric mucosa and is involved in the control of food intake and reward, but its relationship to crib-biting is not yet known. The aim of this study was to examine the concentration and circadian variation of plasma ghrelin, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and β-endorphin in crib-biting horses and non-crib-biting controls. Plasma samples were collected every second hour for 24h in the daily environment of eight horses with stereotypic crib-biting and eight non-crib-biting controls. The crib-biting horses had significantly higher mean plasma ghrelin concentrations than the control horses. The circadian rhythm of cortisol was evident, indicating that the sampling protocol did not inhibit the circadian regulation in these horses. Crib-biting had no statistically significant effect on cortisol, ACTH or β-endorphin concentrations. The inter-individual variations in β-endorphin and ACTH were higher than the intra-individual differences, which made inter-individual comparisons difficult and complicated the interpretation of results. Further research is therefore needed to determine the relationship between crib-biting and ghrelin concentration.},

The software has been used in several studies e.g. to study sleep in dairy calves, emotions in goats and the mind wandering related to computer use during lectures.CowLog 3 is implemented using JavaScript and HTML using the Electron framework. The framework allows the development of packaged cross-platform applications using features from web browser (Chromium) as well as server side JavaScript from Node.js. The program supports using multiple videos simultaneously and HTML5 and VLC video players.CowLog can be used for any project that requires coding the time of events from digital video. It is released under GNU GPL v2 making it possible for users to modify the application for their own needs. The software is available through its website http://cowlog.org.},
